-- The Fabled (Laws) of Quantum Mechanics --
Law 1: All players always exist in a superposition of all characters and states in which they could possibly be.


Law 2: Players tell the Storyteller their choices and information each night, which become true unless mechanically impossible. Players learn when they make an impossible choice, and must change that choice. If mutually exclusive events would occur simultaneously, one occurs at random.


Law 3: Players receive specific prompts if and only if their superposition has collapsed to only contain states where they receive that specific prompt.


Law 4: Players appear to die if and only if their superposition has collapsed to only contain states where they have died. If a player’s superposition collapses in such manner during the day, the player appears to die after the execution of that day.


Law 5: Players can nominate and vote without consuming their vote token if and only if they appear alive.


Law 6: The game proceeds in strict night order, but if a player's choice is impossible, they make a new choice for the entire night (ideally submitting multiple possibilities at once, processed in order submitted), so they may submit a choice that will happen before their first attempt would have happened in the night.


Law 7: Starting alignment will be rolled randomly. After that, starting evils (if any) will learn each other and then submit who they learn as demon/minions within that team when they submit N1 actions. Evil starting information happens simultaneously, at the very start of N1.


Law 8: All game rules are always followed, and the setup is always valid.


Law 9: The game continues if possible, ending if and only if its superposition has collapsed to only contain states where it ends.


Law 10: When the game ends, good wins ties within a possible game state (per normal BotC rules; example is executing the demon at final 3). Evil wins ties between possible game states (unique Quantum rule; example is executing the superpositioned Lleech/Pukka at final 3).

-- Quantum Character Rulings --
Atheist: It will be determined at setup whether or not there is an Atheist in play. If there is, three things become true: 1) an Atheist is locked in-play, 2) All players will be assigned a Good alignment, and 3) the game is no longer subject to the Quantum Laws. Instead, I will approve or reject submitted actions at my discretion, with the goal of simulating a non-Atheist Quantum game. As in normal Clocktower, regardless of whether or not the Atheist is in play, executing the Storyteller always ends the game, with a win for the Good team if there is an Atheist and a win for the Evil team if there is not.


Cannibal: Any player using an ability that could be a Cannibalized form of that ability will retain Cannibal in their superposition until/unless it is eliminated. Duplicate abilities (via Cannibal) will act at that ability's turn in the night order (in the event that order matters, simultaneously until the specific order is collapsed by interaction).

-- General Quantum Clarifications --
The Drunk thinks they are an out-of-play Townsfolk character that is not a Demon bluff. They must be deceived into having one singular Townsfolk ability (the ability of the out-of-play Townsfolk token they would be dealt at setup in a normal game), and this character would remain the same if the Drunk changed (via a Barber swap.)
A player who is drunk, poisoned, or receiving false information due to the Vortox must receive information it would be possible for a soberhealthy	 character to receive in a possible gamestate at the time they receive it (though not necessarily a gamestate that is possible given previous actions in the game, and not necessarily their own character.) For instance, a drunk Mathematician could not learn an 11 on the first night, but a drunk Empath could learn a 3.

-- Quantum FAQs --
Q: What do I get assigned at the beginning of the game?
A: A starting alignment. Everything else is for you and other players to make happen.


Q: So how does the Evil Team work?
A: Once evil players learn each other, players tell the Storyteller what information they receive. That includes the rest of Evil starting information. To be clear, this means you get to hand-nominate who on your team is Demon, and demon gets to pick their bluffs (which will definitely be out-of-play; for example, if Gambler and Cannibal are bluffs and a Townsfolk tells the Storyteller they choose a player and guess their character, the Storyteller will tell them that is impossible).


Q: What if multiple players give the Storyteller mutually exclusive Evil starting information?
A: See Law 2--one will occur at random. If every Evil tries to be the Demon, Minions will learn that their choice is impossible and be forced to choose again.


Q: How do Outsiders work?
A: The setup is always valid. That means if there should be 2 Outsiders, that's how many there are, even if it's not clear who they are. As soon as all but two Good players are definitely non-Outsider, those two must be Outsiders, and anything that would require either of them to be Townsfolk will be impossible. A Baron may be locked in or out of play by possible Outsider count, and if a Baron must be in play, the required Outsider count increases by 2.


Q: How does winning work in practice?
A: Usually, the same as always. The only ways an evil can survive execution is the DA or by being the Lleech (at which point their N1 pick is their host), so if the non-Lleech Demon is executed and a Minion didn't pick them last night, they definitely die (and if the locked Lleech's host dies, they die; if the possible Lleech's host dies, they can no longer be the Lleech--all barring possible Vessel shenanigans). Evil's win condition is a bit more unpredictable, but as more and more of the game state is confirmed, more and more players will be definitely dead, until the game reaches a state where if the Demon is allowed one more night, they will definitely be able to win. If the game reaches a state where a team must win, but it will never be possible to determine which team wins (for example, if a demon has kept their possible-host alive with them to final 3 without locking either Lleech or Pukka), then evil wins. Finally, minions may choose an additional challenge by choosing to learn that the Damsel is in play: if evil can force the game state such that the Damsel must be the living player a minion guesses is Damsel on their first try, evil wins. This is meant to be a challenge, but good might never see the Damsel coming…...


Q: If a choice forces a death to have happened in the past, does that retroactively change past Grimoires? What if that causes a paradox?
A: No, no time travel - if a player's choice on Night 5 makes it so that the Gossip definitely killed Alice on Night 2, the death is just announced the next morning. As of Night 5, Alice has been dead since Night 2, but the players won't necessarily know that, they'll only know that Alice's superposition collapsed on Night 5. Because the game state is always valid, this scenario can only happen if it's self-consistent, so no paradoxes are possible. If it seems weird to you that choices in the present seemingly change the past in a self-consistent manner, look up the delayed-choice experiment. Law 5 modifies Clocktower rules by allowing some dead players to occasionally freely nominate or vote, and does so purposefully to avoid paradoxes.


Q: How does submitting "I don't wake" work as a night action?
A: "I don't wake" is an attempt to affirmatively lock in no-wake at every point in the night order, that passes or fails when night order ends. Waking to take any action can get resolved at time that role wakes as possible or not, and then if impossible, your choice will be rejected and proceed to the next submitted action. If two players must have one wake, but one is locked as waking or dead (for example, a player has received a number N1/N2 and must be Empath/Mathematician) that player non-waking is affirmatively locked after the last possible time their superposition can wake as non-waking/dead, forcing the other to wake. Meanwhile, if there are non-waking superpositions left available to a player, they only lock as non-waking at end of night. For players, "I don't wake" is almost always possible unless you know you are locked as waking or dead, in which case backup night actions are appreciated, and is why order matters. Wishing not to wake will be respected if possible.


Q: How does Quantum Atheist work?
A: It will be determined at setup whether or not there is an Atheist in play. If there is, three things become true: 1) an Atheist is locked in-play, 2) All players will be assigned a Good alignment, and 3) the game is no longer subject to normal Clocktower rules or the Quantum Laws. Instead, I will approve or reject submitted actions at my discretion, with the goal of simulating a non-Atheist Quantum game. As in normal Clocktower, regardless of whether or not the Atheist is in play, executing the Storyteller always ends the game, with a win for the Good team if there is an Atheist and a win for the Evil team if there is not.
